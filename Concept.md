Sockets

What is a socket?
  A socket is what programs use to comunicate over the internet. A socket is almost like a power outlet in your home 
  given that based on its shape and location, you can use it. The same goes for sockets on computers. If we need to 
  send a message from Device A to Device B on port 25565 (Minecraft Port) we would create a socket on each end on 
  port 25565. We could then send strings in a UTF-8 format over the internet to the proper socket.
  

Networking Points
- URL, URLConnection, Socket, and ServerSocket classes all use TCP to communicate over the network.
